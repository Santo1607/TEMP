You are a senior full-stack engineer building a production-grade Hospital Temperature Management Web Application.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (modern, clean hospital UI)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database & Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row Level Security)
- Realtime updates: Supabase Realtime
- Notifications: Free SMS API (Fast2SMS or Textbelt – NO paid services)
- Deployment: Replit

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
Build a role-based temperature monitoring portal for hospitals with separate dashboards for:
1. Admin / Management
2. Doctors
3. Nurses

ROLE PERMISSIONS:
- Admin:
  - Full access
  - Add/edit patients
  - Add/edit doctors and nurses (Staff Management)
  - View all temperature data
  - Edit AI-generated temperature thresholds
- Doctor:
  - View only assigned patients
  - View live temperature data
  - Cannot edit thresholds or patient details
- Nurse:
  - View only assigned patients
  - View live temperature data
  - Cannot edit thresholds or patient details

DATABASE SCHEMA (Supabase):
1. patients:
   - id (uuid)
   - name
   - room_number
   - floor_number
   - block_number
   - disease
   - guardian_name
   - guardian_phone
   - doctor_id
   - nurse_id
   - threshold_min
   - threshold_max

2. staff:
   - id (uuid)
   - name
   - role (admin | doctor | nurse)
   - phone

3. temperature_logs:
   - id (uuid)
   - patient_id
   - temp_c
   - temp_f
   - risk_level
   - created_at

FEATURES:
- Live temperature monitoring (Celsius + Fahrenheit)
- Data sent from ESP32 + MLX90614 sensor via REST API
- Realtime dashboard updates using Supabase subscriptions
- AI-based automatic threshold assignment based on disease
- Admin override option for thresholds
- Color-coded risk indicators:
  - Green: Normal
  - Yellow: Warning
  - Red: Critical

AI THRESHOLD LOGIC (Rule-Based, Free):
- Normal: 36.5 – 37.5
- Infection: 36.0 – 37.0
- Post Surgery: 36.5 – 37.2
- ICU: 36.8 – 37.0

ALERT SYSTEM:
- If temperature exceeds threshold:
  - Automatically send SMS to:
    - Assigned Doctor
    - Assigned Nurse
    - Guardian
- SMS content must include:
  - Patient name
  - Room number
  - Floor & block
  - Disease
  - Temperature (°C & °F)
  - Risk level

ESP32 INTEGRATION:
- Create an API endpoint:
  POST /api/temperature
- Accept:
  - patient_id
  - temp_c
  - temp_f
- Store data in Supabase
- Trigger alert logic automatically

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional hospital-grade UI
- Dashboard cards
- Smooth animations
- Responsive layout
- Clear role-based navigation
- No clutter

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate full folder structure
- Clean, optimized, readable code
- Supabase connection config
- API routes
- Realtime listeners
- Alert service module
- Basic authentication flow

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT use paid APIs
- Do NOT use complex ML libraries
- Keep everything simple, stable, and hackathon-ready
